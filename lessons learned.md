1. making use of SVG

if there is a viewbox setting you sometimes can modify the width and height to scale the image.

2. you should put the svg in divs and then apply classes to the div. (for example with transformations on hover). if you have one dv that has in it more divs with SVGs you should use position:relative on it.

3. in my example, in order to overlap 2 svg's I used on one of the div a negative margin, so this moved up the div with the second svg. Also you can apply z-index to the enclosing divs to change the order.
